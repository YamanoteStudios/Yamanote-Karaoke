# Yamanote-Karaoke
An app quickly grab the lyrics of your favorite song and save it your local device.

This app potential a lyric searching app of various Japanese Songs. The app will allow the user to search for the songs by TITLE, AUTHOR, and GENRE.

Problems:

Data is in Excel Format and is way too big to work in Microsoft Excel.

Data Should be moved to a Document Oriented Database (postgres, MongoDB,firebase etc) where we can index and search the database more programmatically.

I am interested in playing with the data through some sort of API but maybe that API should be written in another langauage (PYTHON? ,SCALA?, HASKELL ).
